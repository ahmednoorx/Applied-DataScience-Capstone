# Applied-DataScience-Capstone

## Introduction:
  In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this module, you will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course.

## Problems to find answers:
1. Identify key factors contributing to failed landings & successful landings?
2. Investigate relationships between Rocket variables and success/failure rates?
3. Determine the specific conditions that maximize SpaceX’s landing success rate?

## Summary of methodologies:
  Methodologies: We employed a robust data science methodology, beginning with data collection and cleaning,
followed by exploratory data analysis. We then proceeded to feature engineering and selection, where we
identified the most relevant variables for our models. We utilized various machine learning algorithms, I
including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression
(Logreg) to build predictive models. These models were rigorously validated using techniques such as crossvalidation

## Summary of all results:
  Our analysis revealed that the success of a mission depends on several factors, including the launch site,
orbit, and the number of previous launches. Knowledge gained from previous launches contributes to
transitioning from failure to success. Secondly, our models achieved an accuracy of approximately 83% on
test data, demonstrating their effectiveness in predicting the outcome. Furthermore, the Decision Tree
Algorithm emerged as the most effective model based on its superior accuracy score on training data.
In terms of trends, the success rate shows an upward trend over the decade, suggesting that SpaceX has
been improving its rocket launches, achieving higher success rates as time progresses.
